## Can I explain what my code does?
I created a simple Minecraft adventure game. At the start, players make choices that change their story, like exploring a forest, desert, or the underworld. The HTML file builds the game’s layout, showing the title, questions, and answer buttons. The CSS file makes the game look nice with a Minecraft background and styled buttons. The JavaScript file runs the game by changing the story based on what the player picks and keeping track of their progress.

## What was my coding process?
When I started coding, I first planned the story by writing down the different choices the player could make. Then, I used HTML to set up the layout of the game and added styles to make it look nice. After that, I wrote the JavaScript to make the game work. This part was a bit hard because I had to make the questions and buttons change depending on what the player picked. Finally, I tested everything to make sure the game ran smoothly.

## What challenges did I have?
I had some challenges along the way. One problem was making sure the game updated without reloading the page. I solved this by writing functions that clear the old content and show new options when the player makes a choice. Another issue was keeping track of where the player was in the story, but I handled that by using a variable to store the current game state. Resetting the game was also tricky, but I wrote a function that restarts everything when the player wants to play again.

## What would I do differently now?
If I were to do this again, I would make the story more detailed with extra choices and outcomes. I would also split the JavaScript code into smaller parts to make it easier to handle. To improve the user experience, I might add sound effects or animations to make the game more exciting. I’d also focus more on accessibility, ensuring the game works well for everyone.
